---

### **Session 1: Variables and Data Types**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Understand Go's variable declaration, data types, and how they differ from Java's.

#### **1\. Variables in Go (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Variable declaration:

```c
var a int = 10  
var b = 20  
c := 30  
```

*   
  * Short variable declaration using `:=`.  
  * Scoping and shadowing rules.  
  * Zero values for variables.  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java requires explicit type declaration (`int a = 10;`), whereas Go infers types in many cases.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Students declare and print variables using `fmt.Println`.

#### **2\. Data Types in Go (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * Basic types: `int`, `float64`, `string`, `bool`.  
  * Composite types: Arrays, slices, and maps (brief introduction).

Type conversion:

```c
var x int = 42  
var y float64 = float64(x)  
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java has primitive and wrapper classes (`int` vs `Integer`), while Go uses only basic types.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program to:  
    * Declare variables of different types.  
    * Perform type conversions and print results.

#### **3\. Constants and Iota (30 minutes)**

Using iota for enumerations:

```c
const (  
    Red = iota  
    Green  
    Blue  
)
```

* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses `final` for constants. Go's `iota` simplifies enumeration.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Define constants and use them in expressions.  
  * Create an enumeration for days of the week using `iota`.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (30 minutes)**

**Objective**: Master the use of conditional statements and loops in Go.

#### **1\. If and Else Statements (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Syntax for if and else:

```c
if x > 10 {  
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")  
} else {  
    fmt.Println("x is less than or equal to 10")  
}
```

* 

if with initialization:

```c
if y := x * 2; y > 20 {  
    fmt.Println("y is greater than 20")  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Similar structure, but Go allows `if` with variable initialization.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write programs with `if` and `else` to compare values.

#### **2\. Switch Statements (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Syntax of switch:

```c
switch x {  
case 1:  
    fmt.Println("One")  
case 2:  
    fmt.Println("Two")  
default:  
    fmt.Println("Other")  
}
```

*   
  * Differences from Java:  
    * No `break` needed in Go.

Switch supports multiple expressions:

```c
switch {  
case x > 10:  
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")  
default:  
    fmt.Println("x is 10 or less")  
}
```

*   
* **Practical**:  
  * Write programs to handle conditions using `switch`.

#### **3\. For Loops (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Syntax:

```c
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {  
    fmt.Println(i)  
}
```

* 

Using for as a while loop:

```c
for x > 0 {  
    fmt.Println(x)  
    x--  
}
```

* 

Range-based loops:

```c
for index, value := range array {  
    fmt.Println(index, value)  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * No `while` or `do-while` loops in Go; `for` covers all use cases.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program to iterate over an array and print its elements.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (30 minutes)**

* Write programs to:  
  * Print even numbers from 1 to 20 using `for`.  
  * Use `switch` to print a message for different grades (A, B, C).

    return a + b  
}
```

*   
  * Functions can exist outside of structs (unlike Java methods).  
  * Naming conventions (camelCase).  
  * Calling functions.  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * In Java, methods must belong to a class.  
  * Return types are explicitly declared in both languages.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write simple functions to add two numbers and find the maximum of two numbers.

#### **2\. Advanced Function Features (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Multiple return values:

```c
func divide(a, b int) (int, int) {  
    return a / b, a % b  
}
```

* 

Named return values:

```c
func rectangleDimensions() (length, width int) {  
    length, width = 10, 20  
    return  
}
```

* 

Variadic functions:

```c
func sum(numbers ...int) int {  
    total := 0  
    for _, number := range numbers {  
        total += number  
    }  
    return total  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Go's multiple return values vs Java's need for objects or arrays.  
  * Simpler variadic functions in Go.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a variadic function to calculate the sum of a series of numbers.  
  * Write a function to return both quotient and remainder of a division.

#### **3\. Anonymous Functions and Closures (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Anonymous functions:

```c
add := func(a, b int) int {  
    return a + b  
}
```

    count := 0  
    return func() int {  
        count++  
        return count  
    }  
}
```

*

**Objective**: Learn and practice Go's error handling mechanisms, including `error` types, `defer`, `panic`, and `recover`.

#### **1\. Introduction to Error Handling (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * Go's philosophy: Avoid exceptions; use explicit error handling.

error type:

```c
func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {  
    if b == 0 {  
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("division by zero")  
    }  
    return a / b, nil  
}
```

* 

Checking and handling errors:

```c
result, err := divide(10, 0)  
if err != nil {  
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)  
} else {  
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Go uses explicit error handling (`error` type) vs Javaâ€™s `try-catch` mechanism.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a function to handle division with error checking.

#### **2\. Defer, Panic, and Recover (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

defer: Used for cleanup tasks.

```c
defer fmt.Println("Goodbye!")  
fmt.Println("Hello!")  
```

* 

panic: For unexpected errors.

```c
panic("Something went wrong!")  
```

* 

recover: To handle a panic.

```c
func safeDivide(a, b int) {  
    defer func() {  
        if r := recover(); r != nil {  
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)  
        }  
    }()  
    if b == 0 {  
        panic("division by zero")  
    }  
    fmt.Println("Result:", a/b)  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Go avoids exception-heavy programming (e.g., `NullPointerException` in Java).  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program using `defer` to clean up resources (e.g., closing a file).  
  * Write a function that triggers a `panic` for invalid inputs and recovers gracefully.

#### **3\. Error Handling in Conjunction with Functions (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture & Practical**:

Combine error handling with named return values:

```c
func safeSqrt(x float64) (result float64, err error) {  
    if x < 0 {  
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("cannot compute square root of a negative number")  
    }  
    result = math.Sqrt(x)  
    return  
}
```

*   
  * Write a function to read a file and handle errors like "file not found."

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write programs to:

## **Day 4: Working with Collections and Structs**

**Objective**: Teach students to work with collections like arrays, slices, and maps in GoLang. Introduce structs and demonstrate their use for creating custom data types, highlighting the differences from Java's class-based object-oriented programming.

---

### **Session 1: Collections in Go**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Understand and effectively use arrays, slices, and maps in Go, including their key operations and differences from Java collections.

#### **1\. Introduction to Arrays (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Definition and declaration:

```c
var arr [5]int  
arr[0] = 10  
fmt.Println(arr)  
```

*   
  * Array length is fixed; cannot be resized.  
  * Iterating through arrays with `for` and `range`.  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java arrays can store primitives and objects; Go arrays store fixed-size values.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Create an array to store 5 integers, assign values, and print them.  
  * Find the maximum value in an array.

#### **2\. Working with Slices (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Slices are dynamic views over arrays:

```c
slice := []int{1, 2, 3}  
slice = append(slice, 4)  
fmt.Println(slice)  
```

* 

Create slices using make:

```c
slice := make([]int, 5)  
```

* 

Slicing an array:

```c
arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
slice := arr[1:4]  
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Similar to `ArrayList`, but with no need for explicit type declarations like `List<Integer>`.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Create a slice, append elements, and print the length and capacity.  
  * Copy one slice to another.

#### **3\. Maps in Go (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Definition and usage:

```c
scores := map[string]int{"Alice": 95, "Bob": 80}  
scores["Charlie"] = 70  
delete(scores, "Bob")  
fmt.Println(scores)  
```

* 

Checking for existence:

```c
value, exists := scores["Alice"]  
if exists {  
    fmt.Println("Score:", value)  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Similar to `HashMap`, but keys must be comparable.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Create a map to store student names and grades.  
  * Write a program to count the frequency of words in a string.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write programs to:  
  * Reverse an array.

* **Lecture**:

Defining and using structs:

```c
type Person struct {  
    Name string  
    Age  int  
}  
person := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}  
fmt.Println(person)  
```

* 

Accessing and modifying fields:

```c
person.Age = 30 
```

 

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Similar to Java classes but no inheritance.  
* **Practical**:

  * Write a program to update a book's information.

#### **2\. Methods in Structs (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Adding methods to structs:

```c
func (p Person) Greet() {  
    fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s.\n", p.Name)  
}  
```

* 

Pointers vs value receivers:

```c
func (p *Person) IncrementAge() {  
    p.Age++  
}
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Methods in Go can have value or pointer receivers; no `this` keyword required.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Add methods to the "Book" struct to display details and update the year.

#### **3\. Nested Structs and Anonymous Fields (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Nesting structs:

```c
type Address struct {  
    City, State string  
}  
type Person struct {  
    Name    string  
    Age     int  
    Address Address  
}
```

* 

Anonymous fields:

```c
type Employee struct {  
    string  
    int  
}  
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses explicit composition with objects, while Go allows anonymous fields for quick embedding.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Create a nested struct to represent a student with personal and address details.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write programs to:

## **Day 5: Concurrency in Go**

**Objective**: Teach students the fundamentals of concurrency in Go, focusing on goroutines, channels, and Go's concurrency model. Compare Go's concurrency approach with Java's threading model.

---

### **Session 1: Introduction to Concurrency and Goroutines**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Understand the basic concepts of concurrency in Go, focusing on goroutines and their lightweight nature.

---

#### **1\. Concurrency Basics (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * Definition of concurrency vs parallelism.  
  * Why concurrency is important: improving responsiveness and performance.  
  * Go's concurrency model and advantages over Java's threading model.

#### **2\. Goroutines (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * What is a goroutine?  
    * Lightweight threads managed by Goâ€™s runtime.

Creating and running a goroutine:

```c
func sayHello() {  
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")  
}  
go sayHello()  
```

* 

Main function and goroutines:

```c
func main() {  
    go sayHello()  
    fmt.Println("Hello from main!")  
}  
```

*   
  * Importance of synchronization (introduce channels briefly, to be covered in detail later).  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses `Thread` and `Runnable` classes, which are heavier compared to Go's goroutines.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program to create a goroutine that prints numbers from 1 to 5\.  
  * Launch multiple goroutines and observe their execution order.

#### **3\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write a Go program to:  
  * Create 5 goroutines, each printing a different message.  
  * Simulate concurrent downloading of 3 files by using goroutines.

---

### **Session 2: Channels for Communication and Synchronization**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Learn how goroutines communicate using channels, including unbuffered and buffered channels, and understand their role in synchronization.

---

#### **1\. Introduction to Channels (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * What is a channel?  
    * Mechanism for communication between goroutines.

Declaring and using a channel:

```c
ch := make(chan int)  
go func() {  
    ch <- 42  
}()  
fmt.Println(<-ch)  
```

* 

Unbuffered vs buffered channels:

```c
ch := make(chan int, 2)  
ch <- 1  
ch <- 2  
fmt.Println(<-ch)  
fmt.Println(<-ch) 
```

 

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses `BlockingQueue` or other libraries for inter-thread communication, which is more verbose.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Create a program to send and receive integers between two goroutines using a channel.

#### **2\. Synchronization with Channels (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Synchronizing goroutines with channels:

```c
done := make(chan bool)  
go func() {  
    fmt.Println("Task completed!")  
    done <- true  
}()  
<-done  
```

* 

Closing channels:

```c
close(ch)  
```

* 

Iterating over a channel:

```c
for val := range ch {  
    fmt.Println(val)  
}  
```

*   
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program to create a producer-consumer pattern using channels.  
  * Synchronize 3 goroutines using a single channel.

#### **3\. Select Statement (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Multiplexing channels with select:

```c
ch1 := make(chan int)  
ch2 := make(chan int)  
go func() { ch1 <- 42 }()  
go func() { ch2 <- 99 }()  
select {  
case msg1 := <-ch1:  
    fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", msg1)  
case msg2 := <-ch2:  
    fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", msg2)  
}  
```

*   
  * Default case in `select`.  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java lacks a native `select` mechanism but uses tools like `ExecutorService` or `CompletionService`.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program to handle multiple channels using `select`.  
  * Add a timeout mechanism to a channel operation.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write Go programs to:  
  * Use channels to calculate the sum of numbers concurrently.  
  * Simulate a chat application where messages are sent between goroutines using channels.

---

### **Wrap-Up and Homework**

**Time Duration**: 30 minutes

1. **Recap (15 minutes)**

## **Day 6: Error Handling and Testing in Go**

**Objective**: Teach students the principles of error handling and testing in Go. Highlight Go's unique approach to error management compared to Java's exception handling. Provide hands-on experience with Goâ€™s testing framework and tools.

---

### **Session 1: Error Handling in Go**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Understand Go's error-handling philosophy and practice implementing robust error-handling techniques in Go programs.

---

#### **1\. Introduction to Error Handling in Go (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * Error handling in Go:  
    * Go uses explicit error values rather than exceptions.

error type in Go:

```c
type error interface {  
    Error() string  
}
```

* 

Checking for errors:

```c
result, err := divide(10, 0)  
if err != nil {  
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)  
    return  
}  
fmt.Println("Result:", result) 
```

 

*   
  * Key benefits:  
    * Encourages handling errors close to where they occur.  
    * Reduces unexpected behavior in production.

#### **2\. Creating and Using Errors (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Using errors.New and fmt.Errorf to create errors:

```c
import "errors"  
func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {  
    if b == 0 {  
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero")  
    }  
    return a / b, nil  
}
```

```c
import "fmt"  
func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {  
    if b == 0 {  
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("cannot divide %d by %d", a, b)  
    }  
    return a / b, nil  
}
```

*   
  * Wrapping errors with additional context using `fmt.Errorf`.  
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses `try-catch` blocks for exceptions, which can obscure error propagation paths.  
  * Go favors simplicity and explicitness over stack traces.  
* **Practical**:  
  * Implement a simple calculator with error handling for invalid operations.  
  * Write a function to open a file and handle errors if the file does not exist.

#### **3\. Custom Error Types and Handling (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Creating custom error types:

```c
type DivideError struct {  
    Dividend int  
    Divisor  int  
}  
func (e *DivideError) Error() string {  
    return fmt.Sprintf("cannot divide %d by %d", e.Dividend, e.Divisor)  
}  
```

*   
  * Using custom errors for better error management.

Leveraging errors.Is and errors.As for error type assertions:

```c
import "errors"  
if errors.Is(err, targetError) {  
    fmt.Println("Matched specific error type")  
}  
```

*   
* **Practical**:  
  * Write a program with custom error types for different error scenarios.  
  * Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` to handle multiple error types.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write Go programs to:  
  * Handle errors for file reading and provide meaningful messages.  
  * Create a custom error type for invalid user input and use it in a form validation function.

---

### **Session 2: Writing and Running Tests in Go**

**Time Duration**: 2 hours  
**Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of testing in Go using the built-in testing package and tools.

---

#### **1\. Introduction to Go Testing (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:  
  * Importance of testing in software development.  
  * Goâ€™s built-in testing package (`testing`).

Writing a simple test:

```c
func TestDivide(t *testing.T) {  
    result, err := divide(10, 2)  
    if err != nil {  
        t.Errorf("Unexpected error: %v", err)  
    }  
    if result != 5 {  
        t.Errorf("Expected 5 but got %d", result)  
    }  
}
```

* 

Running tests:

```c
go test  
```

*   
* **Comparison with Java**:  
  * Java uses frameworks like JUnit, which are not built into the language.  
  * Go simplifies the process by integrating testing natively.

#### **2\. Writing Table-Driven Tests (45 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Table-driven tests for handling multiple scenarios:

```c
func TestDivide(t *testing.T) {  
    tests := []struct {  
        a, b, expected int  
        expectError    bool  
    }{  
        {10, 2, 5, false},  
        {10, 0, 0, true},  
    }  
    for _, tt := range tests {  
        result, err := divide(tt.a, tt.b)  
        if (err != nil) != tt.expectError {  
            t.Errorf("Unexpected error state: %v", err)  
        }  
        if result != tt.expected {  
            t.Errorf("Expected %d but got %d", tt.expected, result)  
        }  
    }  
}
```

*   
* **Practical**:  
  * Write table-driven tests for a calculator program.

#### **3\. Benchmarking and Coverage (30 minutes)**

* **Lecture**:

Writing benchmarks with testing.B:

```c
func BenchmarkDivide(b *testing.B) {  
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {  
        divide(10, 2)  
    }  
}  
```

* 

Running benchmarks:

```c
go test -bench .  
```

* 

Measuring test coverage:

```c
go test -cover  
```

*   
* **Practical**:  
  * Add a benchmark test for a sorting function.  
  * Run coverage analysis for the calculator program.

#### **4\. Hands-on Practice: Mini Challenges (15 minutes)**

* Write Go programs to:  
  * Test a function that checks for prime numbers.  
  * Benchmark a string concatenation function.  
  * Analyze test coverage for a file-reading function.
